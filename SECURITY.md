# Security Best Practices

## Docker Security
1. **Non-root User**: The application runs as a non-root user (UID 1000) inside the container
2. **Minimal Base Image**: Using slim-bullseye to reduce attack surface
3. **Image Scanning**: Regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy
4. **Resource Limits**: Enforcing CPU and memory limits to prevent DoS

## API Security
1. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data is stored in environment variables, not in code
2. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting with FastAPI middleware
3. **Authentication**: Implement API key or OAuth2 authentication for production

## Model Security
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Output Filtering**: Consider implementing content filters for model outputs
3. **Prompt Injection**: Be aware of prompt injection attacks and implement guardrails
4. **Model Access Control**: Restrict access to more powerful models in production

## Network Security
1. **Isolated Network**: Services communicate over an isolated bridge network
2. **Minimal Port Exposure**: Only the necessary API port (8000) is exposed
3. **HTTPS**: In production, place the API behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS

## Data Security
1. **Volume Persistence**: Use Docker volumes for persistent data with proper permissions
2. **Data Purging**: Implement policies for removing old data
3. **Backup Strategy**: Regularly backup the Chroma DB volume
